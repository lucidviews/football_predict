# football_predict
A university project for the module Enterprise Architecture of Big Data at HWR Berlin.

In this project we have built an interactive streamlit web application. The user can choose a league and two teams out of the specified league and will then be 
provided with various infos on how these teams would right now play against each other. It also shows a bunch of statistics about the two teams that may be 
interstingto the user. 
The data comes exclusively form the API "FOOTBALL-API".
The final app was dockerized and is deployed via Caprover here: https://footballpredictor.cjn-online.codes/ 

Best,
Chsiom, Florian and Lucas
